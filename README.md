# odin-landing-page
Project #2 in The Odin Project

A lot of experimenting with CSS and HTML. Had to repackage and containerize multiple pieces of the HTML file to fit correctly.

CSS class names could be cleaner and reused more often for commonly used styles in this HTML page.

Overall very happy with this project. Took a few days working on and off to get the design where I wanted it to be. Flexbox is incredible!
